5 worst ux profiles and why :

1. http://www.davekellerportfolio.com/ - This was a tricky one. I love the color profile of his website. However, I didn’t like that he tucked away his contact information into a hamburger menu. I think this website sacrificed important content in the name of simplicity.
2. http://jedmund.com/about - I understand that this designer wished to showcase his designs but I was a little disappointed at the coldness of his site. It didn’t feel personable at all.
3. http://mikehince.com/about/ - It doesn’t seem personal. It’s too bland for my taste. I want a peek of this designer’s personality.
4. http://theworstportfolioever.com/ - self explanatory.
5. http://www.zekeshore.com/ - doesn’t have much personality, website feels outdated.
